The constant evolution of computing and connectivity requires continuous learning and application of new technology and skills.</p><p>I enjoy collaborating with marketers, designers and developers and working on projects where I can develop and streamline code using the latest technologies and concepts. I have extensive experience in the core web technologies: Javascript, HTML5 and CSS3. I have also worked with: Amazon AWS, GITHUB, Apache Velocity, CVS, Node.js and npm, Angular.js, Express.js, EJS, mySQL, Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketch, Video Editing and the Apple and Android Pay API’s. I also understand SEO optimization, A/B testing, ad tracking and digital acquisition marketing.</p><p>On a personal side, I have enjoyed building and designing from an early age- from model trains and aircraft to model rocketry and large scale radio-controlled aircraft. More recently I put all these construction and design skills to use building and contracting our homes. I enjoyed the hands-on process from architectural planning, framing, electrical circuits, plumbing, tile work and carpentry all the way through to finishing. My other passion is aviation and I acquired my private pilot’s license in 2008.</p><p>In 2014, my family relocated to the Raleigh-Durham area and I have enjoyed working remotely for Time Inc. and trading my weekday 2.5 hour roundtrip commute for more time with my family.</p>",

    {
      "copy" : "<p>My portfolio was created to showcase my most recent projects as well as a means of describing my personality and wide array of interests. A design goal was to create a clean, easy to use site that could be used to demonstrate my current skills while pushing me to explore and implement new techniques and technologies.</p><p>Site development began with creative research. This consisted of gathering ideas and developing a general style to follow. Wireframes and site flow were sketched using paper and pencil. Site requirements were compiled and analyzed. After this I began researching some of the newer web technologies and chose AWS and Node.js to serve my portfolio.</p><p>The layout was designed in Sketch using the hand drawn wireframes as a starting point. This stage included color and font selection as well as creation of the logo. The creative process also included mobile first followed by desktop versions which were viewed on actual devices to ensure a quality user interface and design.</p><p>Once the site was designed and finalized in Sketch I installed Node.js on my AWS LightSail server instance. This was followed by the installation of express.js as my web framework software and EJS as the templating language. These technologies would serve my HTML pulling data from a JSON file, which will be upgraded to a database at some point. DOM manipulation is handled by JavaScript. CSS media queries render the proper layouts for both mobile and desktop, mobile being first priority.</p><p>After studying code examples and reviewing online classes I began to develop my web app. Pages were coded (HTML), stylized (CSS) and JavaScript functions were created to handle visual effects. Testing and review was done using both Safari and Chrome and their respective inspectors. Testing on Android devices was accomplished via the Android device emulator. PC browsers were accesses via Mac OSX running Windows on Parallels. While debugging and fine tuning the functionality, user experience, layout and design I continuously committed changes via command line to Git Hub. On the server instance I would then pull the latest committed files to the live server.</p><p>Other features of this project include:</p><ul><li>Images optimized.</li><li>Resources, including images served via Amazon’s Cloudfront CDN.</li><li>Web app running on lightsail server instance which has the ability to perform a complete instance backup.</li><li>Registered with Google Web Tools for statistics.</li><li>Node.js and Express.js enable scalability, including the future use of a database.</li><li>All server and client side technologies used, current and future, are JavaScript based.</li><li>Coded cleanly using HTML5.</li><li>CSS written locally as .scss and preprocessed via Sass.</li><li>UI via CSS media queries.</li><li>Motion and visual elements are handled via CSS for simple fast rendering within browser.</li><li>Image use is solely for figures and galleries, all other graphical elements are created via CSS.</li><li>Designed mobile first, with an interest in keeping the code and files light.</li></ul><p>A general breakdown of technologies used are as follows:</p><ul><li>HTML5 for the page structure along with CSS3 for the layout. This includes use of media queries, viewport width and height values and most importantly flexbox layout.</li><li>JavaScript handles visual effects, such as image overlay, image parallax and header banner image features. I’ve incorporated some of the new ECMAScript 6 features such as constants and block-scoped variables, as well as  template literals and arrow functions.</li><li>Node.JS and NPM as the backbone of my site, pushing it into web app territory. Using node as my second tier I integrated web app structure into my portfolio site. At the moment using a JSON data file but in the future I plan on adding a database as the third tier.</li><li>Along with Node.js, there are additional packages installed on my server instance such as Express.js, EJS, and nodemailer. Express.js is the web app framework for Node.js, which supports the development of my web application. EJS is the templating language that generates my HTML using plain JavaScript.</li><li>AWS has been utilized for hosting my site on a server instance running node.js. Node.js, package installation via npm and repository access is managed via Command Line Interface.</li><li>I’ve also used AWS CloudFront for content delivery of my site resources.</li><li>Along with these newer technologies, I’ve continued to use Photoshop and Sketch to handle the creative portion of my portfolio. Photoshop is used to crop, resize and adjust images. These are optimized for minimum size, maximum quality. Sketch is the OSX application I used to create the design for the site, both mobile and desktop. Once the design was finalized to about 90% HTML/CSS coding began.</li></ul>",
