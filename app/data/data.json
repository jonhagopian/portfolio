      "copy" : "<p>My name is Jon and my key attributes are: creativity, construction, organization and education. I enjoy connecting with people and the environment whether it’s is through travel, hobbies or work.</p><figure><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Born in New Jersey and currently living in North Carolina near Raleigh, I’ve worked in suburban offices, midtown New York City and remotely from my home office. Over the past fifteen years I’ve been exposed to online marketing, educational multimedia, large team e-commerce efforts and small freelance projects. While working I’ve enjoyed connecting with many great people on both social and professional levels. The constant evolution of computing and connectivity has lead me to learn and apply new technology and skills while working in web development or graphic design.</p><p>As a child I was always building and designing. I created scaled down scenes for model trains at age 8. Building small wooden model aircraft from kits was the next hobby tackled. This was followed by model rocketry, radio control cars and finally large scale radio control aircraft and helicopters. All these hobbies had three aspects, design, construction and action. My knowledge and skills, largely self taught, served me well through life. Instead of playing video games I learned how to use most wood craftsman hand tools. I gained electrical knowledge wiring and soldering circuits for electric motors, battery packs and servo operated control systems. I cut and shaped metal for engine mounts and exhaust systems. On the creative side I designed color schemes for flying aircraft and intricate sets for small plastic scale models. Recently I’ve put all these skills to use in the real world building and contracting a high end home in New Jersey followed by the completion of our 3rd Floor at our current home. In both cases I’ve worked on the architectural planning, framing, electrical circuits, plumbing, tile work and carpentry all the way to finishing. I’ve also fulfilled a dream of mine to fly, acquiring my private pilots license in 2008. During flight training the skills acquired during my childhood years returned, serving as a foundation for aircraft mechanics, aircraft systems, aviation physics, communication, navigation and weather.</p><p>My interest in computers was sparked by art and aviation. On the art side I would edit photos and videos which eventually lead to graphic design and web development. Computers supplemented my aviation interest by powering the flight simulators I’d experiment with. Eventually I began building computer systems for flight simulation and gaming.</p><p>With respect to web development I obtain satisfaction from the creation of a script, css or HTML structure that successfully accomplishes an objective. A design or concept can be instantly tested both physically and visually using target devices or simulators providing a sense of accomplishment. On top of this I’m happiest when a client, teammate or co-worker is satisfied with my efforts.</p><p>I’m a hard worker and enjoy supporting the team. I really like to work on projects where I can develop and streamline code using the latest technologies and concepts. In the future I look forward to assisting clients or organizations with web projects using the three core web technologies Javascript, HTML5 and CSS3. I’m continually learning new software and have experience with: Amazon AWS, GITHUB, Apache Velocity, CVS, Node.js and npm, Angular.js, Express.js, EJS, mySQL, Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketch, Video Editing and the Apple and Android Pay API’s. Complementing my physical skills is knowledge gained from exposure to SEO optimization, split testing, tracking and digital marketing.</p>",
